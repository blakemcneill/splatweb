            We are a community of hackers and makers, teachers and students. Our ultimate goal is to reach out to each other and the surrounding community to share our passion for art, technology, and innovation. Through sharing this passion, Splat Space members contribute to the technical and artistic vibrancy of Durham, and the Triangle as a whole.
